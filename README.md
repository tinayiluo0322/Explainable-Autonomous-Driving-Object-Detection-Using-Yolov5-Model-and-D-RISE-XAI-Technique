# Explainable-Autonomous-Driving-Object-Detection-Using-Yolov5-Model-and-D-RISE-XAI-Technique
This notebook explores the interpretability of object detection models in the context of autonomous driving. The primary focus is to test the performance of a pre-trained YOLOv5 model on sample images, followed by generating visual explanations using the D-RISE technique.
